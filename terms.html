        <div class="terms-meta">
          These terms govern ProCan Sanitation LLC’s commercial trash receptacle cleaning services and any selected add-ons.
          If you are reviewing this from the intake form, you may return at any time using <b>Close</b>.
        </div>

        <div class="terms-highlight">
          <p class="small" style="margin:0;">
            <b>Plain-English summary:</b> We clean the receptacles you select, on the cadence you select. You keep bins empty and accessible.
            You authorize payment. If access is blocked or bins are full, we may skip that visit. Our liability is limited to what you paid for service.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2>1) Services</h2>
        <p>
          ProCan Sanitation LLC (“Provider”) provides commercial trash receptacle pressure washing and sanitation services (“Services”) at the service address
          provided by the client (“Client”). Services may include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Pressure washing of interior and exterior receptacle surfaces</li>
          <li>Application of professional-grade sanitizing and deodorizing agents</li>
          <li>Removal of debris, buildup, grease, and contaminants to the extent reasonably achievable</li>
          <li>Before/after photo documentation for proof-of-service and quality control</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2) What is not included</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Trash removal (receptacles must be empty prior to service)</li>
          <li>Hazardous waste handling (medical waste, chemicals, sharps, etc.)</li>
          <li>Repair or replacement of damaged receptacles</li>
          <li>Interior dumpster cleaning unless separately quoted and agreed</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3) Client responsibilities and access</h2>
        <p>
          Client is responsible for ensuring receptacles are <b>emptied</b>, <b>accessible</b>, and <b>safe to service</b> at the scheduled time.
          If access is blocked (locked enclosure, vehicles, construction, etc.), conditions are unsafe, or receptacles are not empty, Provider may
          skip service for that visit. Skipped visits due to Client-controlled conditions may remain billable.
        </p>

        <h2>4) Scheduling</h2>
        <p>
          Services are performed on a consistent service day within a reasonable service window (typically during business hours).
          Scheduling may be adjusted due to weather, holidays, equipment issues, staffing, or other operational constraints.
          Provider will make reasonable efforts to reschedule when a visit is missed for Provider-controlled reasons.
        </p>

        <h2>5) Add-on services</h2>
        <p>
          If selected by Client, add-on services (e.g., dumpster pad pressure washing, one-time deep clean) will be priced and scheduled
          as shown in the intake quote and included in the total due.
        </p>

        <h2>6) Pricing, billing, and payment authorization</h2>
        <p>
          Client authorizes Provider (and/or its payment processor) to charge the selected payment method for amounts due under the selected plan.
          Recurring services are billed automatically according to the billing cycle selected (monthly / quarterly / annual, if offered).
          One-time services are due upon confirmation.
        </p>
        <p class="small">
          If quarterly or annual discounts are offered, they apply only while the corresponding prepayment term remains active.
          If annual billing is offered, it may require minimum monthly contract value as stated in the quote.
        </p>

        <h2>7) Cancellations</h2>
        <p>
          Either party may cancel recurring service with <b>15 days’ notice</b>. Client remains responsible for charges for services performed
          and any amounts due prior to the effective cancellation date.
        </p>

        <h2>8) Photos and communications</h2>
        <p>
          Client consents to Provider capturing before/after photos for proof-of-service, quality control, and (if Client separately consents)
          marketing use. Provider may communicate via phone, SMS, or email using the contact details provided.
        </p>

        <h2>9) Subcontractors</h2>
        <p>
          Provider may use qualified subcontractors to perform Services. Provider remains responsible for overall service delivery.
        </p>

        <h2>10) Satisfaction / re-clean policy</h2>
        <p>
          If Client is not satisfied with a completed service visit, Client must notify Provider within a reasonable time (recommended within 48 hours).
          Provider may, at its discretion, re-clean the affected receptacles at no charge as the exclusive remedy for that visit.
        </p>

        <h2>11) Limitation of liability</h2>
        <p>
          Provider is not responsible for pre-existing damage to receptacles or surrounding property, nor for issues outside Provider’s reasonable control.
          To the maximum extent permitted by law, Provider’s total liability arising from or related to Services is limited to the amount paid by Client for
          the applicable billing period in which the claim arose. Provider is not liable for indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages.
        </p>

        <h2>12) Compliance</h2>
        <p>
          Client represents that receptacles serviced contain standard municipal/commercial waste only, and that no hazardous materials are present.
          Client is responsible for compliance with any site-specific rules, landlord requirements, or municipal regulations.
        </p>

        <h2>13) Electronic acceptance</h2>
        <p>
          By checking the acceptance box in the intake form and clicking <b>Confirm</b>, Client agrees these Terms & Conditions apply to the order
          and authorizes Provider to proceed with Services and payment as quoted.
